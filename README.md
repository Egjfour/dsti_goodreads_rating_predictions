# Goodreads Rating Predictions
This project was created as part of the Python Machine Learning Labs course at DSTI - School of Engineering during the Spring 2024 Rentr√©e.

This is a Kedro project. All content is located within the [goodreads-predictor](goodreads-predictor/) directory. Please see the README in that directory (within the kedro project) for more details.

NOTICES:
- Any kedro terminal commands must be run from within the goodreads-predictor directory
- It is essential that pandas 2.2.2 or greater is used (We recommend starting with a fresh environment for this project)
- The model training pipelines can be taxing on computer resources. To avoid this, the [project_summary notebook](goodreads-predictor/notebooks/project_summary.ipynb) has a summarized process and results walkthrough that does not require you to run this model
- Model results may be slightly different between runs of the modeling pipelines
